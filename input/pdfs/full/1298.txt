Road systems (including ordinary traffic monitoring and street signal control sys-
tems and toll way (peage) systems with toll gate tickets and payment), railway systems (incl.
mixed train traffic on general nets with, for example switch [aiguillage] interlocking and
other signaling subsystems), air traffic systems (across ground control, terminal or tower
control, area control, etc.), and, for example, container vessel shipping across sea lane be-
tween harbours, all share underlying abstractions such as transportation nets with hubs (road
intersections, train stations, airports and harbours) and links (road segments, train tracks, air
and sea lanes) and their states of being open or closed for certain flows of traffic across hubs
and along links, etc.
In this talk we shall first hint at an abstract formal model for such transportation and
then show how it can be refined into models for road traffic, train traffic and air traffic. Then
we likewise hint at how such, so-called domain models  -- which reflect only what there is
"out there", in reality, before computing and communication--- can be rigorously trans-
formed into requirements for respective traffic monitoring and control systems.
The talk concludes with a discussion of issues of development of the right systems,
that is, the systems that customers (that is, transportation and traffic authorities) expect to
receive, and of systems which are right, that is, correct.
