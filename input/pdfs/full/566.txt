Abstract: Partial Least Squares regression and Principal Components Regression make possible to 
relate a set of dependant variables Y to a set of independent variables X, when there is 
multicollinearity. This paper suggests a new approach for analyzing the net interest margin. After using 
the PCR method, the determinants of the net interest margin have been viewed through a PLS model. 
 
Keywords: Partial Least Squares Regression, Principal Components Regression, net interest margin. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
The exhaustive development requires a deep survey on the set of events that can generate unfavorable 
variations and that have a negative effect on the national economy. The banking institutions represent 
an important market that has an efficient role in the development and the creation of a new economic 
politics. We identify the various risks to which the banking system is exposed. If they are badly 
managed, these risks can affect the bank’s objective and can lead to unfavorable situations. We carry 
out a statistical and econometric study to identify which principal risks that have an effect on the 
banking profit and reflect the reality economic of this market. 
This research points out the determinants of the net interest margin in the Tunisian banking structure. 
The article is divided into two sections. In the first part we introduce some tools Partial Least Squares 
regression (PLS) and the Principal Components Regression (PCR) and we justify the choice of the PLS

approach. In the Last part we present an application of the PLS regression to net interest margin data 
and we compare the results with those obtained by the PCR methods. 
 
DATA AND METHODS  
We will explain the net interest margin (NIM), which is measured by the ratio of the difference 
between returned in interest and the expenditure of interest on the product banking net by eight 
exogenous variables such as:  
Spread (SPREAD): is a variable defined as the difference between the debtor rate and the credit rate.  
The implicit interest payment (IMPL): is appreciated by the ratio of the difference of the expenditure 
except interest and the incomes except interest on the results rough of exploitation.  
The credit risk (CRDTR): is measured by the ratio provision on the sum of appropriations.  
The solvency risk (SOLVR): is appreciated by the prudential ratio which requires a proportional 
relation between the own capital stocks of each financial establishment and its balanced credits.  
The interest rate risk (IRR): is measured by the ratio of short-term credit on the total credit.  
The liquidity risk (LQDR): is estimated by the liquid asset ratios on short-term liability.  
The opportunity cost (OPPC): is measured by the ratio of the reserves held on the total credit of the 
bank.  
Management Effectiveness (MEFF): is measured by the ratio of the product banking net on the total 
credit (Angbazo, L. 1997). 
 
PLS regression  
PLS regression is a recent technique that generalizes and combines features from principal component 
analysis and multiple regression. It is particularly useful when we need to predict a set of dependent 
variables from a large set of independent variables. It originated in the social sciences (specifically 
economy, HermanWold1966) but became popular first in chemometrics and in sensory evaluation 
(Martens and Naes, 1989).But PLS regression is also becoming a tool of choice in the social sciences 
as a multivariate technique for non-experimental and experimental data a like (Mcintosh, Bookstein, 
Haxby and Grady, 1996). It was first presented as an algorithm akin to the power method (used for 
computing eigenvectors) but was rapidly interpreted in a statistical framework. (Frank and Friedman, 
1993; Helland, 1990; Hoskuldsson, 1988; Tenenhaus, 1998). 
Advantages of PLS regression: 
 handles multicollinearity 
© Revue MODULAD 2010 - 61 - Numéro 41 
 robust in terms of data noise and missing values 
 balances the two objectives of explaining response and predictor variation thus predictions are 
more robust 
 calibrations generally more robust 
 single step decomposition and regression 
 can give good insight into underlying relationship between variables. 
By contrast, PLS regression finds components from X that are also relevant for Y. Specifically, PLS 
regression searches for a set of components that performs a simultaneous decomposition of X and Y 
with the constraint that these components explain as much as possible of the covariance between X and 
Y. This step generalizes PCA (Tenenhaus M., Gauchi J. P. and Ménardo C. 1995). 
PLS regression consists in identifying the vectors u1 and t1 by maximizing the identity  
   
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )111111 var.var.,,cov ututcorut = .  
Where  
 t1 corresponds to new calculated variables as a linear combination of X vector t1 summarizes X 
at the same time to appreciate X but also to predict Y. In the same way, we can identify a vector 
u1 which corresponds to the new variables predicting Y. In the particular case where Y0 
corresponds to a scalar (only one independent variable), u1 is compared to Y0. 
 P1 and r1 respectively indicate the column vector of the coefficients of regression of X0 and Y0 
on t1. 
PLS regression is an iterative method. It is resumed in three stages (Tenenhaus 1995)  
Stage 0: starting by tables X and Y.  
Stage 1: construction of components u1 and t1 of the columns of X and Y respectively by maximization 
of covariance between these two components and to build the two equations:

Stage 2: resumption of stage 1, but we replace tables X and Y by the residues X1 and Y1. What gives 
two new components t2 and u2 linear combinations of the columns of X1 and Y1 respectively. 
From where two new equations:

The iterations continue until th component may explain Y in a satisfactory way (Tenenhaus M. 1999). 
Just like the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the PLS regression makes possible to reduce the 
dimension of a study. Contrary to the PCA which seeks to reduce only one matrix X of the variables, 
the PLS will make possible to work at the same time on the matrix X and the matrix Y. The PLS 
consequently makes possible to model the matrix Y according to the matrix X.  
 
Principal Components Regression (PCR) 
The Principal Components Regression is the method of combining linear regression with principal 
component analysis. The principal component analysis can gather highly correlated independent 
variables into a principal component, and all principal components are independent of each other, so 
that all it does is to transform a set of correlated variables to a set of uncorrelated principal components. 
Then we built the regression equations with a set of uncorrelated principal components and get the 
‘best’ equation according to the principle of the maximum adjusted R2 and minimum standard error of 
estimate.  
The following approach proceeds in three stages.  
Stage 0:   Proceed a stepwise regression with a dependent variable Y and all independent variables X 
for getting the p independent variables with statistical significances and revealing whether the p 
independent variables have a mutlticollinearity or not. 
Stage 1: Proceed a PCA with the p independent variables for transforming a set of correlated variables 
to a set of uncorrelated principal components and indicating information quantities of different set of 
principal components. 
Stage 2: build the Principal Components Regression equation with the first principal component, then 
add principal component backwards one by one. Then determine the ‘best’ equation on the basis of the 
maximum of adjusted R2 and minimum standard error of estimate.

Table 1 presents the cross validation, and shows that we preserve only one component.  
The choice of the component is based on the cross validation, which should not exceed the limit.We 
notice that starting from second component, the cross validation becomes negative (-0.32).

The coefficient of the credit risk is negative. This indicates that the average of the interest margin drops 
if the bank credits are contracted. If the margin is fall, the establishment is sensitive to the fluctuations 
of the market interest rate, from which the market credit rates were improved by instruments whose 
principal role is to ensure a limitation of the credit risks according to the financial standing of the 
establishment while applying the credit rationing. 
The solvency risk  
The coefficient of solvency risk is negative. This is due to the fact that the banks substitute their own 
capital stocks by the debts which generate a reduction of insolvency risk and involves a fall of the costs 
of loans which requires a weaker allowance for insolvency risk. We also notice that this risk has a weak 
fluctuation during the period of study. This is due to the fact that the Tunisian banks seek to satisfy the 
prudential solvency rules.  
Opportunity cost   
The coefficient of this variable is positive. By defined, it is the output credit profit which gives up 
the depositors to hold the liquidity; it increases the cost of funds beyond the rate observed. To 
compensate for it, the bank will be brought to integrate an additional premium in the interest margin. 
The rate risk  
The rate risk has a positive coefficient. This coefficient means more the rate risk increases more the 
bank becomes demanding with its customers and requires more of the interest margin. The positive 
sign of the rate risk can be explained by the fact that the granted appropriations are appropriations of 
long term, then, the bank becomes concerned since it is not able any more to envisage the economic 
situation of its customers as well as the evolution of the future interest rate. In this case it runs a 
potential risk and thus will require a premium of maturity.  
The liquidity risk  
This risk is the incapacity to provide the withdrawals with the depositors or the granting of credit. This 
is due to the behavior of Tunisian trade banks which aim at rather holding a position of speculative 
costs than to a position of prudential liquidity. The bank holds the behavior of amateur to the risk. 
The implicit interest payment  
This variable is negative during all the study. The resources without interest exceed the expenditure 
without interest. The implicit coefficient of payment admits a positive sign. This is due to the payment 
into extra with the depositors through the service of handing-over or another type of transfers  
 
 
Spread

It is expected that the coefficient of variable is positive. This is due to the effort of the 
disintermediation undertaken, the recourse to the other forms of debts and the money market, which 
generates a reduction in the degree of our function of intermediation.  
Management effectiveness   
The management effectiveness admits a positive coefficient. We generally wait until a good 
management of the bank influences, in a positive way, its deposit and credit policy like its marketing 
policy in order to manage improving the interest margin; which is the case.  
 
Result of the principal components regression  
The application of the principal components regression is carried out by the software SPSS which 
provided statistics of collinearity such as the tolerance and variance inflation factor (VIF).  
Tolerance = 1- 2iR , where 2iR  is squared multiple correlation of ith variable with other independent 
variables. When its value is small (close to 0), the variable is almost a linear combination of the other 
independent variables. VIF is reciprocal of tolerance. Variables with low tolerance tend to have large 
VIF, so variables with low tolerance and large VIF suggest that they have collinearity. The eigen value, 
condition index and the variance proportions are also indices of collinearity. If the index of collinearity 
is more than 15, this indicates a possible problem and an index greater than 30 suggests a serious 
problem with collinearity.  
The execution of SPSS gives us seven significant variables which are CRDTR, SOLVR, OPPC, 
LQDR, IMPL, SPREAD and MEFF. The results are presented in the following table 2.

According to the values of collinearity statistics and condition index, we conclude the existence of 
multicollinearity. We will check whether there are multicollinearities among the independent variables. 
It also displays that condition index of three independent variables is more than 30. The MEFF can be 
written as a linear combination of the variables since it has a weak tolerance, tends to zero (0.088) and 
VIF (11.36). After a factorial analysis, we find seven principal components. We built the principal 
component regression equation with the first component C1, then add principal component backwards 
one by one and get ‘best’ equation according to the principal of the maximum of adjusted R2 and 
minimum standard error of estimate mentioned in table3.

We notice that if we add the seventh component, R2 decreases and the standard error of the estimate 
increases. Thus, the best equation function is according to six components.

This table shows that the component five is not significant; so we will make the regression by 
excluding this component. We noticed that R2 does not change (0.964) but the standard error of the 
estimate decreases by 0.047 to 0.042 and all the components are significant.

The five components which were retained explain more than 96% of the original variance. The 
interpretation of the axes is specified by the factorial co-ordinates of each variable. We can thus 
identify the effect of each axis on the interest margin and not on the variables of origins. When 
according to this result, the use of the principal components regression method does not make possible 
to check the individual impact of each explanatory variable. Therefore, we deduce the importance of 
PLS regression compared to the Principal Components Regression.  
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The method of PLS regression represents a more immediate approach since the analysis of interest 
margin is explicitly carried out by the variables of origin. However, the method of Principal 
Components Regression, presupposes an interpretation of the factorial axes on which the regression 
will be carried out. 
The contribution of PLS regression by the principal components regression is the fact that PLS 
regression helps us to release the effect of each variables. The PLS regression helps the bank to 
release the variables on which it act to increase the interest margin, because PLS regression 
preserves all the initial variables. On the other hand, the principal components regression eliminates 
some variables by carrying out a principal component analysis, which has a principal interest to 
reduce the dimension of the space of the variables in order to better visualize them.
