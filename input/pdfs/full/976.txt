Model-driven development (MDD) is an approach to development of software systems 
that is steadily gaining new adherents in industry. This is due to its clear potential for major 
improvements in productivity and product quality over more traditional development meth-
ods. There have been numerous successful applications of MDD in industrial and other pro-
duction environments that have unequivocally demonstrated its viability and effectiveness. 
However, at present, MDD comprises a rather mixed collection of ad hoc technologies and 
methods, mostly of which were developed by industrial teams responding to specific prob-
lems and immediate market requirements. Consequently, there is very little or no clear theo-
retical foundation that would provide the basis for systematic and technically sound introduc-
tion and application of this important new approach. This has not only resulted in technical 
problems, but has also greatly impeded the wider penetration of MDD in practice. 
In this talk, we first look at some of the key characteristics of MDD, discuss the current 
state of the art, and review some of the salient results achieved in practice. Next, we examine 
what is needed to provide the necessary theoretical basis for MDD and identify specific key 
areas of required research. Finally, we describe a new initiative by the Ontario Centres of 
Excellence and the IBM Centre for Advanced Studies created specifically to support the 
exploration of this fertile new terra incognita
