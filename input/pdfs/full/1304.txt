The thesis we wish to illustrate consists of showing that the safety-critical control indus-
try has designed a very strong model-based development method in order to face the severe
safety requirements it has to face. We shall illustrate this thesis based on the methods in use
at Airbus in the design of early fly-by-wire systems. Then we describe the evolution of this
method from these pioneering times up to the present time and show what could be an ideal
workflow today. Then we present a recent advance in this framework consisting of faithfully
implementing control systems in a multi-tasking framework in such a way that the imple-
mentation matches what has been modelled. We show how we can achieve this goal and
show that this approach has also be taken in the Matlab/Simulink code generator. We con-
clude by drawing some perspectives for the future.
