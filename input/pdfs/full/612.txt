Keynote Abstract 
Personalizing e-services by allowing users to express preferences is becoming more and more 
common. When querying, expressing preferences is seen as a natural way to avoid empty results or 
information flooding as well as a solution reducing the user effort in carrying out complex 
searches.  
This is particularly beneficial in the OLAP context, since multidimensional databases store huge 
amounts of data. Besides, OLAP queries have a complex structure: they do not only formulate 
selections and projections on attributes and measures, they also specify on what hierarchical 
attributes data are to be aggregated. Finally, during an OLAP session, the user often does not 
exactly know what she is looking for. The reasons behind a specific phenomenon or trend may be 
hidden, and finding those reasons by manually applying different combinations of OLAP operators 
may be very frustrating. 
Though a lot of research has been carried out during the last few years on database preferences, the 
problem of developing a complete theory of preferences for multidimensional databases has been 
mostly neglected so far. 
The presentation discusses how personalization can be applied to the OLAP context and proposes 
some practical examples.
