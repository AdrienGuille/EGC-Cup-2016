What is supervised learning?
9 Supervised learning refers to the capability of a 
system to learn from examples
9 The trained system is able to provide an answer for
each new question
9 Supervised means the desired output for the training 
set is provided by an external teacher
9 Binary classification is among the most successful
methods for supervised learning

Classification on data streams
Many applications:
9 Computer network traffic (spam, intrusion
detection,…)
9 Bank transactions (fraud, credit cards,…)
9 Web search (link rating)
9 Video/Audio sensors (video surveillance,  face 
identification,…)

Binary classification problem can be formulated as a 
generalized eigenvalue problem (GEPSVM).

Problems
9 Standard classification methods rely on the persistence
of a complete training set
9 Data not well represented by a persistent collection of 
items
9 Data may be accessed but not completely loaded in 
main memory or stored
European Workshop on Data Stream Analysis, March 2007

Incremental classification
A new approach consists in finding a small and robust subset of 
the training set while accessing data available in the window
When the window is full, all points within are 
processed by the classifier

It is possible to incrementaly train an algorithm using one point at 
time, analyzing its contribution of information.
Improvements:
9A smaller set of points reduces the probabilty of overfitting
the problem
9It is computationally more efficient in predicting new points
9As new points become available in the window, their
influence is evaluated with respect to the existing classifier

SI-ReGEC has the lowest error and 
uses the smallest incremental set

Numerical Results
Larger windows lead to smaller train 
subset and execution time increases
with window growth

Conclusions
9 SI-ReGEC:
1.achieves a classification accuracy well comparable
with other methods
2.produces smaller incremental training sets
Future Work:
Investigate how to dinamically adapt window size
to stream rate and nonstationary data streams
