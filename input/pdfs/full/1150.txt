In the present paper we aim to define a strategy able to extract in  accurate way 
information from sea waves streaming data.
The problem derives from an applicative field:
evolving streaming data coming from multisensor system .

3Sea waves streaming data structure 
The engineering problem usually consists in analyzing the role of the main breaker types, that
takes place at submerged breakwaters, in determining the characteristics of the wave profile in 
protected area. Since the detection of slope change point depends from the breaker type, several
structure are considered.
A multysensor system reveals the rupture of each sea waves on the several breakwaters. The data 
produced by sensors, assume the form of flows of curves evolving continuously over time.

Overview on clustering streaming curves
In literature clustering curve datastream is usually known as time series
streameanig data clustering. It has been handled in several ways, the two major 
approaches are based on:
Symbolic representations
Keogh, E., Chu, S., Hart, D., Pazzani, M.:
An Online Algorithm for Segmenting Time Series. In Proceedings
of IEEE International Conference on Data Mining. 289–296, (2001).
Incrementally construct
The dimensionality of the  symbolic              
representation is the same  as the original 
data, and virtually all data mining 
algorithms scale poorly  with 
dimensionality.
Rodrigues, P., Gama, J., Pedroso J. P.: Hierarchical Time-
Series Clustering for Data Streams, Proceedings of First 
International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Data 
Streams, 24 September, Pisa, Italy, (2004).
Drawbacks:
These are very interesting from a computational 
point of view and the system is able to exhibit
dynamic behavior, adapting to changes in time-
series, but usually the agglomeration phase does
not consider for changes in the cluster structure.
4WDSA 2007
Our proposal
Consists in furnishing a summary of the key characteristics of the data which change over 
time in a fast way.
The strategy, we propose, is an updating version of Dynamical Curve Clustering 
using free knots smoothing spline, performed on sliding windows of fixed size.

The Updating Algorithm
Initialization phase:
– the optimal set of prototypes gc taking into account the data coming from the first sliding window sw are 
computed,
– the curves are assigned to the cluster according the Mean square error,
– the number of curves nc in each cluster are stored in a weight vector,
– representative curves of each cluster, called microprototypes, are identified. These are identified as the 
empirical maximum and minimum values of the obtained prototypal model in a cluster,
– for each cluster, the curves are assigned to their microprototypes according the Mean square error.
Updating phase:
for each sw
– the prototype are computed taking into account the stream of curves in the current sw starting from
the prototypes of the old sliding window (after a transformation in the time axis);
– allocation step: the streaming curves of the current sliding window are allocated to the clusters
according to the criterion of Euclidean distance or some variation of it;
– the number of curves nc in each cluster is updated;
– a new set of microprototypes are identified, recording the number of curves more similar to these
last ones.
5WDSA 2007
Knowledge extraction from phase:
For each sliding window, a set of prototypes and the number of curves belonging to
each cluster is outputed
For each sliding window, a set of microprototypes and the number of curves allocated
to each one is outputed as further information on the data structure
The quality partition index have is able to quantify the goodness of partition and is
such to evaluate if there are anomalies in the cluster structure.

Information Stored: prototypes and best set of knots for each cluster
Note: prototypes are elements representative of each cluster, contrary to other methods 
where the center is not necessarily representative.
The core of the method: 
The Dynamical Curves Clustering Algorithm
WDSA 2007
Each prototype is unequivocally determinated by a non linear minimization 
problem, due to the non linear dependence of the basis curves on the knots.
Each prototype is unequivocally determinated by a non linear minimization 
problem, due to the non linear dependence of the basis curves on the knots.
It is able to find a way to perform classification based 
on the best fitting between the representation function
of the cluster and the allocation function to different 
clusters.
Dynamical clustering algorithm
The advantage to update this method consists in the 
possibilities to work on the representative elements 
of the cluster with a dimensionality reduction 
of the amount of data.

Curve data stream and ANALYSIS
WDSA 2007
Considering curve streams data in a sliding window of length T, 
A curve stream y can formally
be written as a T-dimensional vector y = (y1, . . . , yT )
The core of the methodologyfor each sliding window consists in optimizing the following
criterion:
The system of G = {g1, . . . , gC} of class prototype are computed by optimizing an adequacy 
criterion:
that leads to a free-knot spline estimators of the representative curve prototype.
Where are weights and is the distance function.

9The algorithm to solve this problem is a modified version of  Gervini Algorithm. It 
produces a sequences of knot vectors and a relative function which is optimum, in 
the sense of mean square error, more precisely It is such to minimize the 
Generalized Cross Validation Criteria (GCV).
In this way we estimate the ‘protoypal function’ according to the ‘best set of knots’.

Case study: Streaming curve data, propagation of sea waves
Since the detection of slope change point depends from the breaker type, several structure
are considered.  Expecially a nonlinear boundary-layer theory shows that strong streaming 
is possible for small viscosity.
As stayed before a multysensor system reveals the rupture of each sea waves on the 
several breakwaters. In this context, the data produced by sensors, assume the form of 
flows of curves evolving continuously over time so they constitute a suitable platform to 
evaluate our methodology. They consist of 10000 streaming curves of size 100 from 
several multysensor system located on different place.

cluster structure, since the prototype differently from the other clustering algorithm 
represents the best model representing the clusters.

Conclusions
The proposed techniques seems capable to face the problem of extraction knowledge 
for curve datastream.
It exhibits superior performance in the perspective to catch meaningful characteristic 
of the cluster structure without considering the elements of the clusters but only the 
representative elements.
In  the next step, it will be naturally interesting  to compare our proposal    with the 
existing techniques that have the main aim to extract information.
