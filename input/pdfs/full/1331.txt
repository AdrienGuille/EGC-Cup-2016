Résumé Des résultats innovants en fouille de données complexes fournissent des approches 
originales pour les épidémiologistes qui bénéficient de traitements interactifs pour aborder 
leurs données conjointement sous toutes leurs entrées et en tirer des résultats. L’étude 
présente des algorithmes qui travaillent sur des espaces multidimensionnels de fonctions (ici 
des chroniques ou bien encore des distributions discrètes ou discrétisées à support fini) avec 
moins de perte d’information que dans les codages habituels par agrégation, quantiles ou 
autres ; ils ont été implémentés dans le logiciel DELTA Suite : chaque cellule d’une table 
étudiée contient une donnée complexe (par exemple une série temporelle). Delta Suite est 
utilisé ici dans deux études épidémiologiques de l’évolution des cancers dans le temps et 
dans l’espace: en un premier temps pour la visualisation simultanée et l’exploration des 
chroniques de taux de mortalité par cancer sur cinq entrées conjointes ( géographiques, 
temporelles, âge, sexe et pathologies) puis dans un deuxième temps pour la comparaison 
géographique des courbes d’évolution des cancers du poumon pour 51 pays et 21 années par 
généralisation des approches de classification automatique.

Abstract. Innovating data mining tool for complex data provide new and 
comprehensive viewpoints to the epidemiologist who can derive original results and 
perform interactive treatments. New algorithms working in a multidimensional space on 
curves (such as a set of multiple time series in our study) or on discrete distributions, 
with les loss of information as it is the case with more classical encoding techniques 
(e.g. by data aggregation: means, quintiles etc.) have been studied and have been 
implemented in Delta Suite software. Each cell of the table under study is a function (in 
this case time series). Delta Suite software is applied for comparing epidemiological 
trends w.r.t. time, on two illustrative studies of the WHO data: 
- the simultaneous visualization and exploration of the time series for cancer death rates 
on many entries, geographical information, temporal data, age, sex and pathologies.  
- the geographic comparison of lung cancer evolutions over 21 years by building 
automatic classifications.

1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 A new exploratory approach for time series 
The data of the death certificates that the World Health Organization (WHO) provides officially 
on its servers contain five main entries: death main cause, sex, age class, certificate death country 
(state or province in some cases), death year. These five variables define therefore a 
multidimensional space in which the statistical investigations are performed; a great number of 
multidimensional arrays (usually 2 entries, but quite often 3 and even 4) (Huang 1999) can be built 
in order to perform Multiple Array Analysis (Pardoux 2001). 
Such an approach is seldom used in epidemiology where the main tools are based on the 
juxtaposition of mono valued statistics (Groupe d’étude et de réflexion interrégional 1996). 
Innovating data mining tools for complex data (Gettler- Summa Pardoux 2000) provide new and 
comprehensive viewpoints to the epidemiologist who can derive original results and perform 
interactive treatments. They allow working in a multidimensional space on curves (such as a set of 
multiple time series in our study) instead of sets of single curves (Last and al. 2004) or on discrete 
distributions (Bock Diday 2000), with less loss of information as it is the case with more classical 
encoding techniques (e.g. by data aggregation: means, quintiles etc.). Therefore the data can be kept 
and integrally treated. These original methods have been applied using Delta Suite software which 
was developed by the Research Centre for Decision Mathematics of Paris Dauphine and by Isthma 
Company (France) on two illustrative studies of the WHO data: 
- The simultaneous visualization and exploration of the time series for cancer death rates on 
many entries, geographical information, temporal data, age, sex and pathologies.  
- The geographic comparison of lung cancer evolution over 30 years by applying generalized 
automatic clustering algorithms. 
1.2 Questions in Cancer epidemiology methodology 
It appears that the overall cancer death rate has been about constant in the past 30 years, both in 
Europe and in the United States, with the notable exception of mortality among children and young 
adults. At the same time, there has been a global rise in mortality by lung cancer and slightly less 
important rises of melanoma and brain tumor, whereas one observes a concomitant decrease for 
cancers of the stomach, esophagus and head-and-neck (Gettler Summa and al. 2001). 
Smoking explains certainly the increased lung cancer death rate, but in the meanwhile there is a 
partial decrease in other malignancies such as head-and-neck tumors which are also mainly caused 
by tobacco. The reasons for these multiple and apparently contradictory shifts remain largely 
unknown. The goal of this paper is to address these cancers in cancer epidemiology using statistical 
and mathematical techniques rarely used in the medical community. 
2 Data description 
2.1 The initial array 
The data analyzed in the present work come from a data base of deaths caused by cancer which 
has been extracted from files obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO1981-2000). We 
extracted the number of deaths caused by cancer for 122 countries, both sexes, 21 age-classes 
(ranging from birth to 100+), 13 cancer types and 50 years of data. The original data were organized 
in 1,521,828 lines, 63% of which had missing data and 14,074 of which were containing out of the 
range figures. Odd data were processed by the ‘missing value’ menu in Delta software which is 
described further. 574,200 lines array have been eventually validated.

2.2 Initial data pre-processing 
Since we want to compare country evolutions, we have to normalize the data over the age-
classes; for this purpose, we compute new homogenous ASRs (Average Standardized Ratios) that 
are commonly used in epidemiology (National Center for Health Statistics 1998) 
Since we want to compare temporal evolutions between countries, we have to synchronize the 
various data in order to have the same periods of time for all the countries. 
We have to reconstruct a common denomination for the various types of cancer since the 
nomenclature, ICD, varies along time (at least 4 different ones in the past 50 years).  
The definition of the age-classes, initially given in the database to be of 5 year duration, has to be 
modified according to the cancer type in order to be medically significant. 
91 countries have been retained globally at the beginning of our study since their data can be 
exploited on common periods of time. Furthermore, we have proved by a Khi² adjustment test, that, 
for some countries, the variations of the collected data along any period of time follow a Gaussian 
law: what is effectively measured (in the case of Iceland, e.g.) is more the average value of 
mortality caused by lung cancer than real fluctuations. We have decided not to take these countries 
into account. 
2.2.1 Expert pathology classifications 
Death cause denominations on death certificates have varied during the period of data collecting. 
These evolutions can be found in the 'International Classification of Diseases’ (ICD): for instance 
the hierarchical presentation of some lung diseases is no longer the same since the appraisal of new 
diseases such as AIDS which implies that we have to put them in a different pre-existing group. We 
have taken into account 5 classifications: the 6th ICD from 1949 to 1957, the 7th ICD from 1958 to 
1967, the 8th ICD from 1968 to 1978, the 9th ICD from 1979 to 1998, the 10th ICD from 1999 
(Anderson and al. 2001). 
Comparison indices Ci, for the i-th disease, have been computed for the transitions from one 
classification to the next one; they are applied as weights on data in order to obtain a global final 
array of normalized and homogeneous data: Ci = DiP1/ DiP2 where DIP is the number of deaths 
caused by disease i in the classification period P. 
2.2.2 Standardized rates 
The populations do not present the same age distributions according to the country. But statistics 
show that age has a great influence on mortality by cancer. It is thus necessary in our study to define 
and use a notion of age-normalized ratio and to reconstruct for each population a set of new figures 
corrected in such a way that they propose for each country a unique normalized age structure. The 
standard time scales deal with 5 years age-classes and they can vary according to the projection 
period and to the type of the reference population (worldwide, European, other). New distributions 
are presently being worked out up to year 2020. These ratios are modified by so-called direct or 
indirect adjustments in epidemiology.  
3 DELTA: New Approaches in Data Mining 
The DELTA platform, allows incorporating variation on a single data: probability distribution, 
functional variation etc.: multiple time series are characteristic examples of complex data, where 
variation consists of time evolution. Delta allows managing, editing and analyzing such complex 
data in a multidimensional statistical framework. 
3.1 DELTA METRIC: data manager and editor in the context of epidemiology 
DELTA allows a number of operations on a classical data array in order to build new data arrays, 
significantly more complex since it is possible to define functions as entries of these new arrays. 
It is composed of a graphic editor on complex data which allows a visual exploratory analysis, 
which is completed by statistical numerical indices (regression coefficients etc.) and data 
management options (sorting, filtering etc.) 
3.1.1 The SYNTHESIS operator: taking into account the variations of basic data and 
building the complex data base 
The initial data analyzed in this study concern 51 countries and 21 years of reporting over 9 
pathologies and 16 age classes for both sexes. Pathologies are: malignant tumors of breast, prostate, 
stomach, esophagus, head and neck (lips, mouth, larynx, pharynx …), lung (trachea, bronchus …), 
bladder, pancreas, brain..

TAB. 1 – Initial data 
 
We have built time series by synthesizing the observed data according to time (Year); we thus 
obtained new statistical units where the variables are temporal curves (functions of the time 
variable), such as shown below.

FIG. 1 - Automatic generation of time series for countries, diseases and males, females 
 
One can equally synthesize raw data according to the variable country, thus obtaining new 
variables in the shape of discrete distributions defined on the domain of countries or on the variable 
sex, yielding binary distributions; the age classes could also be used as the synthesis variable. 
The synthesis process produces an array of complex data in which statistical units are described 
in terms of generalized variables: continuous functions, intervals, distributions, lists, discrete 
mapping. Figure 2 presents a sample of an array where several variables are expressed and 
synthesized: ‘’number of deaths during the year’’ function variable (gives the curve for the 
evolution of the number of deaths year per year between 1980 and 2000), ‘’ Raw Death Ratio’’ 
distribution (number of deaths in an age class divided by the population of this class -a percentage), 
‘’ Raw Death Ratio by sex’’ distribution.

3.1.2 Options for the re-encoding of complex data 
The encoding of data is a key step in any statistical analysis: the methods, hence the results 
ultimately depend on the values that have been retained to represent the initial information. 
In the case of a time series, it is usual, during the exploratory phase, to smoothen, deseasonalize 
or decompose the series. DELTA offers these operators on any function obtained during the 
SYNTHESIS process. Another re-encoding allows making more precise a visual feeling on the 
variations of a curve, by means of elementary numerical operators. A polynomial approximation of 
degree 1 was performed (higher degrees can be used) the coefficients of which (steepness ‘a’ and 
origin step ‘b’) characterize each statistical unit and allow an easy interpretation of the cancer 
growth rate. Other re-encoding options have been implemented according to the type of the 
complex data: polynomial approximation, Fourier transformation, regression, BSplines and other 
smoothing options etc.  
3.1.3 Filtering options 
With DELTA, the filtering options are queries that are specified from a dedicated predicate 
editor. They are necessary for any interactive exploratory search. 
For example the result of a double filter onto the curves of the initial data, in order to select all 
the countries and diseases such that their death curves for the age class 50-54 are above the similar 
death curves for the age class 80-84, reveals that this situation occurs for 13 countries over 18, 
mainly for head and neck, esophagus and lung cancers. 
3.1.4 The multiple time series editor 
DELTA contains a complex data worksheet editor for a visual screening of the data. 
Graphic scales Four modes are possible to render a cell:  
• ''Local'' mode, each cell has its own scale (and cannot be visually compared to another). 
• ''Global'' mode, the cells of the same column have a common scale and can be compared to the 
others of the same column. But it is not possible to compare the columns. 
• '' Common'' mode, all the cells have the same scale and can be compared to the others.  
• ''Manual'' mode, the user may emphasize some visual effects. The scales are defined by the user 
at convenience on both axes. 
 
Missing data management Missing data are dealt with by DELTA and are denoted ‘’n/a’’. 
In some circumstances it is possible to re-encode them by a number of smoothing and 
interpolating functions, especially on discrete variables. 36 countries have thus been interpolated 
© Revue MODULAD, 2006 - 41 -  Numéro 34 
 
and/or extrapolated, depending on the reason for which data were missing (no census data for a 
year, delayed ICD, etc.). 
 
 
The Cohort approach The data manager allows to build, among other arrays, cohorts and to 
visualize them (Breslow 1987). Let us show an example on the WHO data. 
Let us imagine tracking persons born between 1916 and 1920. Those who died in 2000 pertain to 
the death statistics of the 80-84 age class, whereas a death in 1980 would put them in the age class 
60-64. Figure 3 exhibits 8 cohorts specified in rows: people born during 4 periods (1920-1924, 
1925-1929, 1930-1934 and 1935-1939), two countries (England and Japan), 4 diseases (head and 
neck, prostate, stomach, lung); in each cell, a discrete mapping: raw death ratios per disease. So 
doing, one can read, at the intersection of row England-1930-1934 and of column age-class-60-64, 
the quotient of the number of deaths of this age class during the years 1990-1994 and the population 
of this age class at this period. 
 
 
FIG. 3 - Visualization of age class cohorts 
 
3.1.5 Statistical results and their interpretation of a study Countries/Cancers/Years 
We now present the major conclusions of a case study that will illustrate DELTA functionalities 
for elementary statistical mining. This study works out statistics on 51 industrialized countries, with 
a western style of life, based on 21 years of data concerning 10 types of cancer and 16 age classes 
(each class being of 5 years duration). 
The conclusions are issued from the analysis of graphs similar to figure 1. They first come from 
a visual analysis of the graphics and then are formally validated by the computation of various 
numerical indicators obtained from the curves, using DELTA tools. 
From the resulting figures, one can assert the following principal facts: 
• the epidemiology of ‘’Cancer’’ is NOT the epidemiology of each ‘’type of cancer’’; for 
instance ‘’all cancers’’ for a given country shows some trends that are contradictory according 
to the pathology (lung cancer is increasing while stomach cancer decreases); for a given 
pathology, very different trends can be observed depending on the country (for the lung cancer 
one can see an important increase in Hungary contrasting with an equivalent decrease in 
England). 
• The proportion of oldest people is the highest for prostate cancer and smallest for lung cancer; it 
increases globally with years, especially for lung cancer. 
• Lung cancer remains the most important in the number of deaths; stomach cancer has 
diminished in a significant manner. 
• All tobacco linked cancers do not follow the same evolutions

3.2 DELTA METRICS multidimensional time series analyzer  in the context of epidemiology  
In order to estimate in a same analysis the influence of the various dimensions (age, country, sex, 
pathology) on the trajectories, a multidimensional approach for curve analysis is necessary. DELTA 
METRICS was used to perform factorial analyses and unsupervised classifications. We present in 
this study the clustering phase results. 
3.2.1 Automatic clustering for the geographic analysis of lung cancer from 1969 to 1998 
DELTA contains several tools for performing unsupervised classifications: one can use a ‘k-
means’ approach or build hierarchical classifications for time series. These algorithms have been 
designed on recent results and generalize previously known methods for quantitative or qualitative 
data to the new universe of functions (Ramsey 1997). 
 Methodology. One of the main methodological elements which distinguish the classical 
classification methods of mono-valued data from the classification of functional data (probability 
distributions, time series, etc.) is the definition of the metrics over the data space. 
This metrics can be defined in two steps. In the first step one computes the dissimilarities 
between the curves representing two distinct statistical units on a single variable. In the second step, 
one computes the dissimilarities aggregates over all the variables. 
 
Dissimilarities computation. The classical dissimilarities have been implemented in DELTA, but 
they have been adapted to the structure of the data dealt with on the platform. 
In the case of discrete applications, three distances between the graphs have been implemented: 
the L  distance, the L  distance and the L  distance. 1 2 max
In the case of continuous functions, defined on subsets of RxR, values intermediate between the 
sampling points which are obtained by a linear interpolation have been used.  
When the envelop of the sample abscissa is not the same for the two mappings, we use by default 
the intersection of the supports. (Other options are possible, such as giving the value 0 when the 
mapping is not defined).

For interval data (the value is a real interval) the Hausdorff distance was implemented 
In the case of finite discrete distributions for the same variable, to build a hierarchical 
classification, the formula used for each variable is inspired from the chi2 distance. 
 
Hierarchical classification of complex data with DELTA. DELTA provides tools for building 
ascending hierarchical classification of complex data. The algorithm presents the remarkable feature 
that the final result of the aggregation process proposes an order on the terminals which optimizes 
the distance to the initial matrix of their dissimilarities (Pak 2005). 
The menu in Figure 4 presents the various possibilities at the three levels of formula choice for 
the algorithm of hierarchical classification for complex data. The aggregation links currently 
implemented are δ , δMax  Min and the mean link. The distances between statistical units for the same 
variable are listed at 3.2.2.1 and the aggregation functions between variables can be the maximum, 
the geometric mean or the weighted quadratic sum.

FIG. 4 - Parameters for the automatic classification 
 
Main results. We now present and comment a hierarchical classification of the ASRs 
concerning lung cancer for 51 countries over 21 years.  
The classes of curves have been computed by the ''Minimum link'' method and yield a 8 classes 
partitions; the countries are ordered as it can be seen on the following dendrogram. 
 
 
FIG. 5 - Classification of countries 
 
We have chosen eight homogeneous groups among all possible partitions: 
•  Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom (value: high then medium, trend: decreasing) 
•  Italy, USA, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Austria, Switzerland, Finland, 
Denmark, Hong Kong (value: medium-high, trend: steady then decreasing) 
• France, Spain, Greece, Argentina, Cuba (value: medium, trend: steady) 
•  Russian Federation, Estonia, Poland, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Belarus, 
Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Rep. of Moldavia, Armenia (value: medium then high, trend: 
increasing) 
• Trinidad & Tobago, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and 
Kyrgyzstan (Value: very low ) 
• Portugal, Norway, Israel, Sweden (low value, trend: steady then slightly increasing) 
• Kuwait, Costa Rica, Mexico, Venezuela (Value : Low; trend: slightly decreasing) 
• Rep. of Korea, Croatia, Hungary (Highly increasing) 
Japan has particular features: low and steady values for 40-74 then slightly increasing (value 
and trend). 
We have next computed the mean curve for each class, then the distances (see 3.2.2.1) of each 
time series to the mean of its class and the paragon for the curves of each class is the country, 
which has the closest time series to the mean (height paragons plus Japan on Figure 6)

FIG. 6 - 9 typical time series for lung cancer epidemiology 1980-2000 
 
In addition to the trend typology being classified in 9 groups, the major observation is that the 
paragon curves of the ''western style'' countries migrate towards an interval of values much smaller 
in 2000 than twenty years before, with the ''exceptions'' of Hungary and Russia. This observation is 
coherent with and refines the result shown in Figure 7: the inter-geographic variation coefficient of 
lung cancer for these countries decreases between 1980 and 2000.

4 CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES 
From a methodological point of view, this paper demonstrates the bonus that the tools of 
multidimensional analysis bring into the domain of epidemiology on huge mass of information in 
the exploratory phases. Furthermore, the epidemiological data are temporal by essence and DELTA 
SUITE software gives the opportunity to take time into account. The main innovation presented in 
these studies is the fact that each cell of the table under study is a function (in this case time series). 
We have thus been able to study and to compare epidemiological trends w.r.t. time in several 
dimensions (geographic, age, disease type, sex) and, particularly, to build typologies for countries in 
terms of the mortality evolutions of various cancer types since 20 years. 
The results show stability and at the same time some clear evolutions in the mortality induced by 
cancer. If the global mortality, all the sites being put together, stands almost unchanged, the 
mortality by sites shows big variations. The exploratory data mining of large volumes of mortality 
data by cancer in the world is therefore useful to reveal the links between various factors or groups 
of factors. It should also allow estimating the respective weights of these factors on mortality by 
cancer. In order to achieve this objective, we have to develop new specific modules for the 
treatment of complex time series that will extend DELTA capabilities: quantitative modeling, 
forecasting tools in particular. As a natural extension in the epidemiological study, we should add a 
number of new variables addressing new potentially relevant domains: life style, food, growth 
speed, psychological trends, etc.
