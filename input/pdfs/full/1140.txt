Definition of data stream (DS)
Data stream mining
Data stream mining is the process of knowledge extraction
from data produced at a high rate . The relation structures
characterizing data are transient and they should be detected
in real time and data should not be stored for a long term
(Muthukrishnan, 2003).

Association/affinity analysis of binary data streams
The focus is on binary strings recording the presence/absence
of a set of attributes (items):
a binary stream can record the pages of an e-commerce
web-site visited by a user in a single session
the presence/absence of attributes can refer to the
different stata of a production process being monitored

Aim of the proposal
Association/affinity analysis of binary data streams
The general aim of the proposal is to monitor through
visualization the transient association structure among sets of
items (attributes): in particular, changes in the association
patterns are observed with respect to a starting situation. The
starting association structure can be user-defined:
referred to previous data
status of co-occurrence of attributes for which the process
is stable

Binary data streams: tabular data
Matrix formalization of binary streams
Consider a binary record as a p-dimensional vector storing the
presence/absence of a set of observed attributes: a set of n
binary records (n number of records in a single time-frame),
corresponds to an indicator matrix Z(n×p)

Key-elements: quantification
Quantification of binary variables
Use of MCA on binary data is such a quantification of the
starting binary variables into a reduced number of latent
variables. Advantages in monitoring associations:
1 remove noise and redundancies in data
2 show on factorial display the association structures
(multiple associations)
3 reduce the computational costs of upcoming frames
processing through supplementary projection of new data

MCA of binary data stream: steps
Multiple correspondence analysis is a suitable MDA technique
aiming to visually represent the deviation from the
independence condition of a finite set of categorical variables
observed with respect to n statistical units.
1 step1: determination of the starting (reference) situation
through MCA of the matrix Z˜, with Z˜ being the
disjunctive coded version of Z .
2 step2: supplementary projection of the upcoming data on
the factorial display obtained in step1. This step is
repeated at each new frame
3 step3: after a fixed number of time-frames user can
choose whether to update the starting situation, that is to
repete step1 once and keep going with the procedure

Supplementary projection of upcoming streams
Computations for new data
New streams are projected on the farctorial map as
supplementary information. In particular, we define Z∗ to be
the indicator matrix of the data streams of the new time-frame.
There are two possible computations to obtain the
supplementary coordinates for the new streams (Nenadic and
Greenacre, 2006):
the position of supplementary items profiles is obtained
through a weighted average of the standard coordinates of
the row-points
the position of supplementary items profiles is obtained
through a weighted average of the principal coordinates of
the row-points

Simulated data
We generated a data set of n = 500 binary streams described
by p = 32 items. There is a strong assciation structure between
two blocks of items: the first 24 items for the first block, the
remaining 8 items in the second block. Then consider eight
consecutive time frames structured as follows:
data of the first four time frames are generated according
to the same association structure
at each following time frame such association structure is
modified by swapping two items from one block to
another: that is to swap two binary columns of Z∗ more
for each new frame.
