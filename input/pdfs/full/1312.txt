Over the last years, aeronautic industry has changed under the effects of the Euro-
pean market and globalisation. In particular, it is crucial to reduce aircraft development cost
and lead time in order to be competitive on the market while ensuring a high level of safety.
In parallel to these economic objectives, the aeronautic growth foreseen in the two next dec-
ades leads to deliver an important number of aircrafts per year inducing strong industrialisa-
tion constraints. These economic and industrial drivers have a strong impact on all the phases
of the aircraft development process. Consequently, the industrial practises shall evolve mak-
ing research and innovation crucial to aeronautics further development and conducive to
European competitiveness.
This talk will focus on Airbus systems development challenges in the context of a
world-wide market. The key evolutions to conduct in terms of processes, methods and tools
for the next generation of avionics systems will be pointed out. Finally, some possible ave-
nues of cooperation with the research community will be highlighted.
