Context

1. Context
Some words about the potential use of the data Streams at EDF
The use of the data coming from the 32 millions of communicating meters
(installation planed from now to 2013)
Queries :
 Allocation of global consumption among all operator in ¬´ real time ¬ª
 Information system of the Electricity consumption
 Analysis and modeling :
 Marketing and commercial analysis of uses
 Load Forecasting
R&D D√©partement OSIRIS - Work-shop on Data-Stream 2007 (Caserta ‚Äì Italy)5
1. Context
The electric consumption forecasting: Why?
 Long-term (from 2 to more than 20 years)
 Investments in order to make the park of production
Middle-term (from 13 days to 2 years)
Adaptation of the production equipments and the potential purchase on the
financial markets
 Short-term (from one hour to 12 days)
 Balance between Consumption / Production and Sourcing
R&D D√©partement OSIRIS - Work-shop on Data-Stream 2007 (Caserta ‚Äì Italy)6
1. Context
The electric consumption forecasting: how?
 Aggregate time series modeling
 Impossibility to compute, in real time, ¬´ official ¬ª time series, especially
for costumers which have not telemeters meters (method based by
profiling methods)
Non-linear additive models :
 A part dependent on the climate (mostly temperature, and for some
models, cloud cover)
 A part embedding seasonality and trend.
 Aggregate forecasting test:
 Building different models on ¬´ natural ¬ª wallets, and summarizing of the
forecasts
 Same thing, but on groups chosen (or built) specifically to improve global
forecast (by clustering or classication methods)

2. The first reflections and some tracks of research
Some remarks about the source data :
 Space and time characteristics
 ‚Äúquasi-continuous‚Äù temporal characteristics
 Minute by minute measurement (perhaps second by second?)
 Information and data by uses
 Internal and/or external temperature measures
Exhaustive recuperation, or Space and time sampling?
R&D D√©partement OSIRIS - Work-shop on Data-Stream 2007 (Caserta ‚Äì Italy)9
Some remarks on streams and summaries of data :
 We will need to establish quite long historical curves in order to collect the temporal
phenomena such as the tendencies, the seasonal variations and other periodic
phenomena of our data
 the temporal granularities could be all the more broad as the stored data will be
distant in the past
 We will need to work with sufficiently aggregate levels because aggregate curves
would be less random or erratic
 We will need to connect the collected curves to reliable data allowing the qualification
of our data :
 geographical data (even socio-economic)
 contractual data (even information on the uses)
 weather data: measurements, even forecast data
2. The first reflections and some tracks of research
R&D D√©partement OSIRIS - Work-shop on Data-Stream 2007 (Caserta ‚Äì Italy)10
Some hypothesis constraints :
We will not be able to preserve (nor to collect) the whole of the curves of
consumption at the step second or the step minute for all customers .
 Management of a panel with a great number of customers, and that
we will work on specific summaries of theirs consumption curves,
according to the complexities of their own process of consumption
.
 collect curves with different, but constant temporal granularities?
 if the granularity can be established on the level of the meter, maybe we
will be able to recover curves with variable granularities in time for each
sampling curve in order to collect some increasing, decreasing or important
varying individual consumption periods.
 But, how could we summarizing those information? (with a curves
census, or with a curves sampling)
We just have now to think about the way to use these
restitutions of data streams.

Aggregation / Disaggregation of curves and ¬´ Abundance principles ¬ª :
 The data will be very fine temporal and variable by the time granularities
 Hilbertian Auto-regressif models (Bosq)
 Non parametric models on functional decomposition (for example :
additive models with similarity on wavelet coefficients (Cf.
Antoniadis)
 The data will be of space and time nature, and will have to undoubtedly
remain it at the end of the phases of classification (because of the space
aspect in classification).
 To work currently will enable us to use recent data on the level of each
studied wallet.
 Use Symbolic data models to take account the sampling error in each
measure of the estimate curve)

total curve with with sampling design and curves of the sample for
the year N!
To try to improve the result, we use the same data, but in the year
N-1, and the global serie known of the wallet. We compute new
weighting coefficients to estimate the real curve we know!

Al, 2006) concerning work of mesoscale weather forecasting (weather Phenomena
interesting a zone whose area is about a hundred kilometers) by using the data
streams with dynamic filters in order to determine and to analyze some phenomena
releases mechanism. .
 Other work on summarizing problems of temporal and space-time data (see Zhang
and Al, 2003).
 A methodology, named AWSOM (Adaptive, Hands-off Stream-Mining) making it
automatically possible to detect seasonal tendencies or other relevant temporal
phenomena within a framework of data stream while using wavelets decompositions
(see Papadimitrou and Al, 2003 like Papadimitriou and Al, 2004).
 Approaches concerning the multiple and latent variables regressions by stream
incremental analyses (see Teng, 2003).
 And all I try to understand during this Workshop!!‚Ä¶
