Abstract. Methods of analysis of a dataset where the individuals are partitioned
into groups are discussed. These methods encompass known strategies of analy-
sis and a new method called dual generalized Procrustes analysis. The emphasis
is put on how the methods used in the context of multi-block data analysis can
be adapted to the present context of multi-group setting. The similarities and
the differences between the various approaches of analysis are highlighted and
illustrated on the basis of three datasets.
1 Introduction
Very often, it occurs that the same J variables are measured on a set of individuals parti-
tioned in M groups. We shall refer to this setting as multi-group datasets. In order to inves-
tigate the structure of the data in the groups, principal components analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe,
2002), which is an extensively used tool for the reduction of the dimensionality in multivariate
analysis, can be performed on each group separately. Clearly, this strategy of analysis yields
a large number of parameters which is likely to lead to an instability problem of the solution
because of a lack of sufficient data to accurately estimate all the parameters. Moreover, this
strategy of analysis entails a difficulty in interpreting the outcomes and in comparing the re-
sults across the groups. It is also possible to perform PCA on the concatenated dataset where
the rows refer to the individuals from all the groups. However, in this case the total variance
recovered by the principal components mix up both the between and within-group variances.
In order to counteract these problems, several procedures have been proposed using more
parsimonious models than separate PCA on the M groups. For instance, common principal
