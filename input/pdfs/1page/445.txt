1 Introduction
Nowadays, most companies externalize as many services as possible to reduce costs and be
more flexible in front of fluctuations of the demand. Thus, with the cloud, the time has arrived
to IT infrastructures. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud
computing as “a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool
of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and ser-
vices) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service
provider interaction”.
Cloud computing, in general, is a good solution for medium to small companies that cannot
afford a huge initial investment in hardware together with an IT department to manage it. With
this kind of technologies, they can pay per use, instead of provisioning for peak loads. Thus,
only when the company grows up (if at all), so the expenses will. The only problem is that they
have to trust their data to third parties.
In Abadi (2009), we find an analysis of pros and cons of data management in the cloud.
It is found completely inappropriate for transactional processing mainly due to the problems
to guarantee ACID properties in such environment. However, it is adequate for analysis envi-
ronments, since those properties are not needed. It also outlines the problem of having data in
an untrusted environment, which would again be unacceptable in transactional processing, but
can be easily solved in analytical systems by just leaving out some sensitive data or using an
anonymization function. On the other hand, what cloud data management can offer to an an-
alytical environment is elastic compute power (in the form of parallelism), replication of data
(even across different regions of the world), and fault tolerance (a new machine automatically
taking over from a fallen one without re-executing the whole query or process).
DataWarehouses (DW) and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) tools where defined by
Bill Inmon in 1992 and Edgar Codd in 1993, respectively. Thus, they are almost twenty years
old and have evolved to maturity by overcoming many limitations in these years. Huge (Ter-
abytes) relational DW exist today benefiting from techniques like materialized views, bitmap
indexes, etc. Nevertheless, some challenges remain still open. Mainly, they are related to the
management of ETL processes, unstructured data, and schema evolution.
Cloud computing does not mean that we cannot use a relational system. Indeed, well
known alliances already exist in the market, like that between Oracle and Amazon. However,
