Data mining remains an important research area in database systems and a major challenge in
computer science. We present a review of processing alternatives, storage mechanisms, algo-
rithms, data structures and optimizations that enable data mining on large data sets. We focus
on the computation of well-known multidimensional statistical and machine learning models.
We pay particular attention to SQL (together with UDFs) and MapReduce as two competing
technologies for large scale “in-database” analytics, especially with parallel computing. We
conclude with a summary of solved major problems and open research issues.
