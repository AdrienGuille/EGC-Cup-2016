Abstract. In the context of the recent policies concerning anti-money launder-
ing and counter terrorist financing defined by the Financial Action Task Force
Recommendation 16, it is the responsibility of the financial institution to monitor
the quality of the information present in wire transfers. To that end, we present
in this paper an approach to automate the monitoring and the validation of the

is processed as a stream and transformed at each stage. This architecture is in
line with the latest research in data warehouses with stream data processing. We
show that our approach is suitable to the requirements and the standards in the
banking industry.

mision has already initiated the adoption of laws with regards to the Anti-Money Laundering
Directive. 1 Having a European legislation put in place will lead to more and more jurisdictions
adapting their local laws accordingly. It is expected that the proposals will become legislation
in 2015.
2 Enforcing the FATF Recommendation 16
The FATF Recommendation 16 requires that financial institutions include accurate orig-
inator and beneficiary information on wire transfers and related messages. The required in-

adopted by the Parliament.
