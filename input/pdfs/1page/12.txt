Abstract. Data Warehouses (DWs) aim at supporting the decision-making pro-
cess of an organization. In the Requirements Engineering (RE) domain, sev-
eral methods were proposed for the development of DWs, most of them based
on the Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) approach. However,
there is not yet a comprehensive and unified perspective of the various methods
proposed. In this paper, a coherent view of the GORE approach for the devel-
opment of DWs is presented, by classifying existing methods according to the
decision-making process, integrating them together, and linking modeling and
analysis techniques throughout the overall process. The result of our study is an
integrated GORE-based method for the development of DWs. We illustrate the
method with a concrete example from the health care sector.
1 Introduction
Business Intelligence (BI) systems deliver the capability of data analysis in order to contribute
to the decision-making process. A Data warehouse (DW) is a fundamental component of BI
systems. A DW aggregates data from different data sources and specifically structures them
to be used in BI systems. To develop a transaction-oriented system, we often need to take
into account the requirements of how to perform automatically the repetitive operations of an
organisation. However, the analytical requirements supporting the decision-making process
in an organisation need to be captured in order to develop a DW. Such requirements are not
easy to elicit and specify, so that DWs are sometimes developed based on an incomplete and
inconsistent set of requirements, causing many of BI projects to fail. Therefore, the success of
the system under the development can be strongly affected by Requirements Engineering (RE)
(Prakash and Gosain, 2008). RE is defined as the process of discovering the needs of involved
