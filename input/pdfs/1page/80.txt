Abstract. Hotspots, at which many photographs have been taken, might be in-
teresting places for many people to do sightseeing. Visualization of hotspots
reveals user interests, which is important for industries such as tourism and
marketing research. Although several social-based techniques for extracting
hotspots independently have been proposed, a hotspot has a relation to other
hotspots in some cases. To organize those hotspots, we propose a method to
detect and visualize relations among hotspots. Our proposed method detects
and assesses relations of shooting spots and photographic subjects. Our ap-
proach extracts the relations using sub-hotspots, which are split from a hotspot
that includes photographs of different types. We demonstrate our approach by
discovering relations using photographic metadata such as tags, photograph ori-
entation, and photograph locations from Flickr.
1 Introduction
According to the increasing popularity of mobile devices such as digital cameras and smart
phones, numerous photographs taken by photographers have been uploaded to photo-sharing
web services such as Flickr 1 and Panoramio 2. Recently those devices have included embedded
global positioning systems (GPSs). Using them, photographers can readily take photographs
with photographic metadata such as location and photograph orientation information. Par-
ticularly, photographs with a photograph-orientation feature have become numerous recently
(Zheng et al., 2011). In addition, many photographs on social media sites have metadata that
are annotated by users through social tagging.
Many people might take photographs of subjects such as landscapes based on their own in-
terests. Then they might upload those photographs to social media sites. As locations at which
many photographs have been taken, these places might also be interesting places for many peo-
ple to sightsee or visit. As described in this paper, we define such places as hotspots. Figure
