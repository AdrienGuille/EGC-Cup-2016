 1. Introduction 
Often data present a multiway structure, and they can be arranged into  a Three-way Data Set  X, 
i.e.,a set X of n × K × T values related to: K variables measured (observed, estimated) on n objects 
(individuals, products) at T occasions (assessors, times, locations, etc.). Let X1, X2, ..., XK be K 
quantitative variables observed on n units (objects) at T consecutive time points (Figure 1).  
The observed data can be arranged into a three-way longitudinal data set  
  [ ]TtIitxxx ikttititi ,...,1 , :),,...,,( 21 =∈=≡ ⋅yY  
where xijt is the value of the j-th variable collected on the i-th object at time t; I={1,...,n} J={1,...,k}  
and U={1,...,T}  are the set of indices pertaining to objects,  
variables and time points, respectively. 
For each object i, Y(i) ={yi.t t=1,...,T} describes a time trajectory of the i-th object  
according to the k examined variables. The trajectory Y(i) is geometrically represented by T-1 
segments connecting T  points yi.t of Mk+1. Two time trajectories in M 3
