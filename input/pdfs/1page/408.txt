Recently, skyline analysis has attracted a lot of interest due to its importance in multi-criteria
decision making applications. In a multidimensional space where a preference is defined for
each dimension, a point A dominates another point B if A is better (i.e., more preferred) than
B on at least one dimension, and A is not worse than B on every dimension. For example, a
skyline analysis may answer a customer’s query who whishes to buy a flight ticket from Sin-
gapore to Paris with a preference for low prices, short travel time and few transits. Given a set
of points, the skyline set contains the points that are not dominated by any other points. Tradi-
tional skyline computation has always been restricted to the data embedding space of a fixed
dimensionality. Recently, the subspace skyline problem has attracted a fast growing amount of
interest. Given a set of points in an n-dimensional space, users may be interested in different
skyline queries in different subspaces of different dimensions. In this talk we will present the
problem of efficient skycube computation. We introduce a novel approach significantly reduc-
ing domination tests for a given subspace and the number of subspaces searched. Technically,
we identify two types of skyline points that can be directly derived without using any domina-
tion tests. Moreover, based on formal concept analysis, we introduce two closure operators that
enable a concise representation of skyline cubes. We show that this concise representation is
easy to compute and develop an efficient algorithm which only needs to search a small portion
of the huge search space.
