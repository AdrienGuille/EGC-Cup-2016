MICROARRAY DATA MINING: RECENT ADVANCES

All organisms on Earth, except for viruses, consist of cells Yeast, for example, has one
cell, while humans have trillions of cells, All cells have a nucleus, and inside nucleus there is
DNA, which encodes the “program” for making future organisms,

DNA Microarrays is a breakthrough technology [Sch95] that takes a “snapshot” of
activity of many thousands of genes (potentially all genes in a cell) at the same time, It is
creating a revolution in biology that has a potential to provide new and better diagnostics,
lead to personalized treatments, and new cures for many diseases,

Analysis of microarrays presents a number of unique challenges for data mining [PT04a,
PT04b], Typical data mining applications in domains like banking or web, have a large
number of records (thousands to millions) and much smaller number of ﬁelds (at most
several hundred), In contrast, a typical microarray data analysis study may have only a small
number of records (less than a hundred), while the number of ﬁelds, corresponding to the
number of genes, is typically in thousands, Given the difﬁculty of collecting microarray
samples, the number of samples is likely to remain small in many interesting cases,
However, having so many ﬁelds relative to so few samples, creates a high likelihood of
ﬁnding “false positives” that are due to chance — both in ﬁnding differentially expressed
genes, and in building predictive models,

In this keynote talk we present new developments in microarray data analysis that help us
to address these challenges, We ﬁrst examine best practices in microarray data classiﬁcation
[PKR03], including feature selection approaches and examine the global feature selection
bias,

We then discuss the technique of Gene Set Analysis [M003] and show how it can
signiﬁcantly increase the power of analy sis,

Finally we present our results on global microarray data analysis, including pervasive
lognormal distribution in microarray data and our proposal for the Comprehensive
Microarray Test Suite,
