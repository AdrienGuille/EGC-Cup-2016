Abstract. The perception about real estate properties, both for individuals and
agents, is not formed exclusively by their intrinsic characteristics, such as sur-
face and age, but also from property externalities, such as pollution, traffic
congestion, criminality rates, proximity to playgrounds, schools and stimulat-
ing social interactions that are equally important. In this paper, we present the
Real-Estate 2.0 System that in contrary to existing Real-Estate e-services and
applications, takes also into account important externalities. By leveraging Web
2.0 (content from Social Networks, POI listings) applications and Open Data
enables the thorough analysis of the current physical and social context of the
property, the context-based objective valuation of RE properties, along with an
advanced property search and selection experience that unveils otherwise “hid-
den” property features and significantly reduces user effort and time spent in
their RE quest. The system encompasses the above to provide services which
assist individuals and agents in making more informed and sound RE decisions.
1 Introduction
Contemporary real estate economists (Geltner and H., 2007),(Van Dijk et al., 2011) agree that
the value of an apartment, building or land in an urban area is not only represented exclusively
by the intrinsic characteristics of the property, such as the quality, location and size of its
construction, but also by both positive externalities such as proximity to playgrounds, schools,
dynamic local cultural relations, intellectual circuits of exchange, peaceful and stimulating
social interactions; and negative externalities such as air and noise pollution, traffic congestion,
noisy neighbours, high criminality rates.
Real-Estate 2.0, in contrary to existing Real Estate web services and applications (xe 1,
foxtons 2) that are restricted only to intrinsic characteristics of properties, aims to harvest and
integrate various forms of Real Estate (RE) information that is actually available today in various
Web 2.0 sources, under the form of point of interest (POI), content and opinions expressed in
