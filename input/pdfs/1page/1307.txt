Abstract. We are interested in the preservation of local properties of timed com-
ponents during their integration in a timed system. Timed components are mod-
eled as timed automata or timed automata with deadlines. Properties considered
are all safety and liveness properties which can be expressed with the timed
linear logic MITL (Metric Interval Linear Logic), as well as non-zenoness and
deadlock-freedom. Integration of components is a kind of incremental develop-
ment which consists in checking locally the properties of the components, before
integrating them in the complete system, using some composition operator. Of
course, established properties have to be preserved by this integration. Checking
preservation can be achieved by means of the verification of timed τ -simulation
relations. Composability, compatibility and compositionality of these relations
w.r.t. composition operators are properties which allow to reduce the cost of
this verification. We examine these properties when integration is achieved with
two different timed composition operators: the classic operator usually taken
for timed systems and which uses a CSP-like composition paradigm, and a non-
blocking operator closer to the CCS paradigm.
Key-words. τ -simulations, component-based timed systems, integration of com-
ponents, preservation of timed linear properties.
1 Introduction
Incremental development methods are a way to cope with the state space explosion prob-
lem of model-checking, which is increased in the case of timed systems due to the presence
of timing constraints. In particular, for component-based systems, a way to develop incre-
mentally is to use integration of components. This method is indicated for the verification of
local properties of the components. It consists in checking the properties in isolation on the
component before integrating it in its environment, with some parallel composition operator.
Model-checking is there still applicable since the size of the components is generally small
enough. Of course, this method is valid only if established properties of the component still
hold after integration.
