Abstract. Enterprises have gathered operational business information frommul-
tiple structured data sources and stored it in a central repository, called data
warehousing, for decision support functionalities and data analysis. The enter-
prises are now realizing to integrate their entire information sources, including
"unstructured" contents, for deeper and richer information analysis. Several ap-
plications, such as processing warranty claims, finding promotional materials in
real-time based on userâ€™s transaction value, detecting health insurance claim pro-
cessing frauds in (near) real-time by integrating information from various data
sources (some of them may be from the competitors), etc., require integration of
both structured and unstructured information based on events and business poli-
cies. Thus, it is vital for data warehousing to enable the integration of data and
content sources to provide real-time read and write access, to transform data for
business analysis and data interchange, and to data placement for performance,
currency and availability.
In this talk, we will first review the existing technologies in data warehousing
and information integration, and then discuss how the enterprise applications are
moving from data warehousing to (Active) Information Integration system. We
will also discuss an architecture of a new approach for integrating information
based on policies that does not require to defining a global schema (virtualization
approach) or any materialization of pre-computed results (warehouse approach).
We will finally discuss several applications that require such kind of integration,
and show that the current approaches cannot satisfy these applications.
