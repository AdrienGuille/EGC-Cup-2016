1 Introduction
Socio–semantic networks contain two different types of information, the social relation-
ships and information related to the actors such as thematic profiles.
In order to analyze such augmented network from different perspectives, we propose to
influence the communities detection process with semantic information, the clustering process
is divided into two phases. In the first one, the point of view is clustered using Self – Organizing
Maps (SOM) (Kohonen (1997)) to obtain groups based on the similarity of the node features
and changing the weights of the graph according to the semantic groups found. Then, in the
second phase, a classic community detection algorithm is used, based on the topology of the
network.
2 Using the Point of View to Influence the Clustering
A social network can be represented as a non–directed graphG (V,E) where V is the non-
empty set of vertices representing actors andE is the set of edges representing the relationships
among them.
Given a graphG (V,E), C = {C1, C2, . . . , Ck} is a partition of the set V into k non–empty
disjoint subsets Ci.
Let FV be the set of semantic features of the actors of the social network, which can be
represented by a matrix of size |V |× |FV |.
Let F ∗V ∈ P (FV ) \ FV , where P (A) is the powerset of the set A, be a non–empty set of
features to be used to define the point of view PoV .
For each vertex vi ∈ V we assign a binary vector ξi = vi × F ∗V of size |F
∗
V | = f . If the
vertex i has the feature p, 1 ≤ p ≤ f from F ∗V , then ξi,p = 1 or 0, otherwise.
A point of view is defined as the set of all instances derived from the set FV :
